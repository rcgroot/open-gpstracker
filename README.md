# open-gpstracker
Legacy code for the Open GPS Tracker project as created for Android 1.5-2.3 This project uses Eclipse and the deprecated Google Maps for Android V1 API. 

Only very minor maintance will happen here. 

To build and run a version of this app with Google Maps loading you must have 
* a personal pre-depracation Map V1 API key (Adjust `map.xml`)
* valid keystore to match the API key (Generate `keystore.properties` as referenced in `app/build.gradle`)
* adjust the app identifier to match your V1 API key (Adjust `app/build.gradle`)


Future versions of the Open GPS Tracker will be created at:
